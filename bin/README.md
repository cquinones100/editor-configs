# bin

`./sync.sh bin` symlinks every executable here into `~/.local/bin`. To install
just one, pass its name instead: `./sync.sh worktree-from-ticket`.

## worktree-from-ticket

Creates a git worktree on a branch named after a Linear ticket, then opens
claude in it with the ticket as the prompt.

```
wt ABC-123
```

That creates `.claude/worktrees/abc-123-the-ticket-title-slugified` off the repo
root, checks out a matching branch, moves your shell into it, and opens claude
there. The shell stays in the worktree for the whole session, so new tmux panes
and splits open in the worktree too — and you're still there after claude exits.

### Setup

1. **Install the script.** From a clone of this repo:

   ```sh
   ./sync.sh worktree-from-ticket
   ```

   That symlinks this one script into `~/.local/bin` and touches nothing else —
   no other scripts, no editor or shell config. Make sure `~/.local/bin` is on
   your `PATH`. The clone can live anywhere.

2. **Add your Linear API key.** Create a personal key at
   <https://linear.app/settings/api>, then:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.config/worktree-from-ticket
   printf '{"linearApiKey":"lin_api_...","linearWorkspace":"your-workspace"}' > ~/.config/worktree-from-ticket/config.json
   chmod 600 ~/.config/worktree-from-ticket/config.json
   ```

   `LINEAR_API_KEY` in the environment also works and takes precedence, but the
   config file keeps the secret out of your shell config.

   `linearWorkspace` is the slug in your Linear URLs
   (`linear.app/<workspace>/issue/...`). `worktree-from-ticket` does not need it,
   but the tmux `M-l` binding reads it from here to open the current branch's
   ticket, so no workspace or team name has to be committed to this repo.
   `LINEAR_WORKSPACE` overrides it.

3. **Add one line to your shell config** (optional — see below):

   ```sh
   eval "$(worktree-from-ticket init zsh)"
   ```

   Use `bash` instead of `zsh` for bash. This defines the `wt` function.

### Why step 3 exists

Running `worktree-from-ticket ABC-123` directly works fine and needs no shell
setup at all — it creates the worktree and opens claude in it. The only thing it
cannot do is move your shell: changing directory affects only the calling
process, so no child process can relocate the shell that invoked it. That
requires a shell function, which is what `init` prints.

Without it you still get a working claude session in the worktree, but your shell
stays where it was — so new tmux panes open in the original repo, not the
worktree.

The function body lives in the script rather than in your shell config, so it
stays one stable line that never needs re-editing when the tool changes.

### Notes

- Add `.claude/worktrees/` to the target repo's `.gitignore`.
- Rerunning on the same ticket is safe: it reuses an existing worktree, and
  reuses the branch if the worktree directory was removed.
- Pass a different parent directory as a first argument:
  `worktree-from-ticket .worktrees ABC-123`. A full Linear issue URL works in
  place of the identifier.
- `wt-cleanup` is the companion for removing finished worktrees. Install it the
  same way (`./sync.sh wt-cleanup`) if you want it.
