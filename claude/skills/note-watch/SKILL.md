# Note watch

The user keeps a running checklist in a note (the notes app, `bin/notes`) and adds to it while you work. This skill keeps an eye on that note with the Monitor tool, so each item they add reaches you on its own, without them having to say "there are new items". The user starts it on purpose, and it reads only the note they confirm: the notes app keeps a note's text on the Mac, and starting this skill is the user's choice to send that one note to Claude.

Arguments: the note, by title (`Editor Configs Notes`) or path. With none, the note this conversation has been working from, if there is one.

## Ground rules

- Read only the confirmed note, never the rest of the notes directory, apart from listing titles in step 1.
- Change the note only to tick an item you have finished (step 4), editing that line and moving it under the unticked ones, as the user's CLAUDE.md says for notes. Never rewrite the note otherwise.
- An item phrased as a question is answered, not built. An item you can't tell how to do is asked about, not guessed at.

## Steps

1. **Settle the note.** Notes are in `$NOTES_DIR` or `~/Notes`, a note's file named after its title. From the argument, or the note this conversation has been working from, find its file and ask the user to confirm it with `AskUserQuestion` ("Watch Editor Configs Notes?"), even when it seems obvious. When neither names one, list the notes by title, most recently changed first, leaving out `.trash/`, up to ten (titles only, not their contents), and ask which. Start nothing until the user has picked.

2. **Read it.** Read the note and say in a line how many items are still open. Ask whether to work those now, or only what is added from here.

3. **Start watching.** Run the Monitor tool with `node ~/.claude/skills/note-watch/scripts/watch-note.js "<the note's path>"`, described as `new items in <title>`. It prints `NEW: <text>` for each item added after it starts, once its text has stopped changing, and `GONE: …` if the note is moved or deleted. Tell the user it is watching, and how to stop it ("stop watching").

4. **Work each new item.** For each `NEW:` event, read the note again for the item's context, then do it the way this conversation has done its items: in the repository you are working in, following CLAUDE.md, a commit of its own when it changes code, asking first when it is unclear or would do something hard to undo. When it is done, tick it in the note (`- [x]`) and move it under the unticked items, with anything indented under it. Reply in a line or two: what you did, and the commit. Items that arrive while you work on one wait their turn, in order.

5. **Keep it running.** A Monitor watch expires (its start says when, usually after 30 minutes) and sends one notice when it does. Start it again with the same command when that notice comes, unless the user has said to stop. On `GONE:`, say the note has moved or gone, and ask which note to watch, as in step 1.

6. **Stop.** When the user says to stop, stop the watch with `TaskStop` and say so.
