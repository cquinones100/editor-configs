# review-loop

A Claude Code skill that has Codex review the current branch, fixes what it
finds, commits, and reviews again until two consecutive rounds come back clean.
`SKILL.md` is the skill itself; this file is what you need to run it somewhere
else.

## Install

The skill is a Markdown file that tells Claude Code what to do. The work is
done by `codex-review`, a single Node script, so both have to be in place.

1. **Have the tools it runs.** Node 18 or newer. The OpenAI Codex CLI,
   logged in with `codex login`; `codex exec` uses the same login as the
   interactive tool. The GitHub CLI, logged in; the script uses it to fetch the
   PR title, body, and base branch so Codex never needs GitHub access of its
   own.

2. **Put `codex-review` on your `PATH`.** The source is
   [`bin/codex-review`](https://github.com/cquinones100/editor-configs/blob/main/bin/codex-review)
   in this repository. For example:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquinones100/editor-configs/main/bin/codex-review -o ~/.local/bin/codex-review
   chmod +x ~/.local/bin/codex-review
   codex-review --help
   ```

   `~/.local/bin` has to be on your `PATH`; the last line fails if it is not.
   If the skill cannot find the command it stops and says so rather than
   reviewing on its own.

3. **Install the skill.** Copy this directory to
   `~/.claude/skills/review-loop/` so that
   `~/.claude/skills/review-loop/SKILL.md` exists. Claude Code picks it up on
   the next session, and `/review-loop` invokes it.

## What Codex is allowed to do

The script runs Codex with the read-only sandbox and no network for the
commands it runs, no approval path out of it, your Codex configuration and
approval rules ignored so no MCP servers or plugins load, `AGENTS.md` not
loaded as instructions, and only core environment variables visible to
commands. Contributor-written text such as the PR description is fenced in the
prompt as data, not instructions. No per-repository trust step is needed.

The sandbox does not confine reads to the repository; Codex cannot currently do
that without also making the repository writable. Findings that mention paths
outside the repository are flagged in the JSON's `warnings` array, and the
skill tells the runner to read those before acting.

## Using it

In a Claude Code session on a branch that is ready for review, type
`/review-loop`. Add `all` to also act on low-severity findings from the first
round. The skill commits per round, records disputed findings and accepted
known gaps in a notes file it passes back to Codex, stops after two consecutive
clean rounds or five rounds, and asks before pushing.

`codex-review` can also be run by hand for a one-off second opinion. Run
`codex-review --help` for the flags.
