// WebSocket the relay opens to Slack, so nothing on this Mac listens for
// connections. Two tokens, both in the macOS Keychain and never in a file:
// the bot token (xoxb-…) for the Web API, and the app-level token (xapp-…,
// scope connections:write) for the socket. Stored with
//   security add-generic-password -U -a "$USER" -s <service> -w
// which asks for the token rather than taking it on the command line.
