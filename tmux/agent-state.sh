# Tracks what each Claude session in tmux is doing, so the tab bar can show
# which ones are waiting on you, which have finished, and which are working.
#
# Usage:
#   agent-state.sh set <working|waiting|done|clear>   from Claude Code hooks, for $TMUX_PANE; reads their JSON
#   agent-state.sh notification               from the Notification hook; reads its JSON
#   agent-state.sh seen <window_id>           from the pane-focus-in hook
#   agent-state.sh next                       from M-a: go to the tab most in need of you
#
# Each pane running Claude carries @agent_state (working, waiting, or done) and
# @agent_since (when it got there). Its window carries @agent, the most urgent
# state among its panes (waiting, then done, then working), which the
# @agent_marker format in tmux.conf turns into the mark in the tab.
#
# A pane also carries what Claude is doing, from the hook's JSON, for the
# sidebar (lib/sidebar) to show: @agent_activity, its tool call in a few
# words ("Run the test suite", "editing render.js"), set as each tool starts
# (PreToolUse) and kept until the next, and @agent_wait, what it waits on
# ("permission: Bash git push", "asks: Which layout?"), while it waits. An
# AskUserQuestion call is a wait from the moment it starts. @agent_loop names
# the loop a session is running (review, ci, queue or deploy) from the moment its
# skill is asked for, typed as /review-loop, /ci-loop, /queue-and-clean or
# /deploy-test or
# run by the Skill tool, until a new prompt or session: the turns between a
# loop's rounds are the loop's too.
#
# "done" means finished and not yet looked at: a tab still in front a second
# after it was focused loses it (AGENT_SEEN_DELAY, in seconds), so passing over
# it, as the sidebar does while you browse, leaves it, and a session that
# finishes in the tab you are already looking at never gets it.
#
# Claude Code waits on its hooks, so everything here is a few tmux calls and
# nothing else: no network, nothing slow. Hooks must not print either, since
# Claude Code adds some hooks' output to the conversation, and they always exit
# 0 so a tmux hiccup never blocks Claude.
