# tmux reports Claude Code's executable by its name, which is its version
# (2.1.285). Started from a Node script, as claude-here starts it, Claude runs
# as the script's child in the terminal's foreground and tmux reports node.

# Code itself registered: it writes ~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json for each of
# its processes and nothing else writes there, so a program that happens to be
# named like a version, or any other node program, isn't taken for Claude.
# Checked this way rather than with lsof on the executable, which is as
# certain but costs a third of a second a pane and saturates the CPU when
# wt-jump asks for every window at once.
