# The health light in the status line: nothing while all is well, a red mark
# and what is wrong when something that should be running quietly stopped.
# Run by #() in status-left (tmux.conf and update-colors.sh), every
# status-interval, so it is one tmux call and file checks, no network.
#
# Usage: health.sh
#
# What it watches:
#   saves    tmux-continuum's last save is over SAVE_LIMIT seconds old. It saves
#            from a #() job in status-right, so a status line that stops
#            drawing status-right stops the saves without a word.
#   sidebar  the sidebar is on but its daemon (bin/tmux-sidebar) isn't running.
#   relay    bin/slack-relay crashed: its events file is still there, which it
#            removes only when stopped on purpose, but its process has gone.
#   connectors  a Claude connector a feature that is on needs (Slack, Google
#            Calendar, Notion, Fathom…) wasn't connected when it last tried, in
#            the last CONNECTOR_LIMIT seconds (lib/connector.js writes
#            connectors-down, a "<service>\t<when>" line each).
#
# It also starts tmux/repo-update.sh periodic in the background, which checks
# GitHub for new commits to ~/switchboard at most once an hour, since this
# is the one thing tmux runs on a timer. Nothing here waits for it.
