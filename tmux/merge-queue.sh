# Opens the repository's merge queue in the browser, from the M-p palette's popup.
# Usage: merge-queue.sh [path]   (defaults to the current directory, which is
# how the popup passes the pane's)
#
# A queue belongs to a branch, so this opens the one the branch's PR targets,
# and the default branch's when there is no PR. A repository without a merge
# queue shows GitHub's empty queue page.
#
# One gh call either way: the PR's URL holds the repository's, and without a
# PR, gh repo view gives the repository's URL and default branch together.
# The popup shows that it is working meanwhile, and closes once the browser
# has the page; when there is nothing to open, it says why and waits for a key.
