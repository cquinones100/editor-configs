#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Asks which note a tab's work belongs to and records it on the tab
# (@tab_note, a path in the notes directory), for M-e to show beside it
# (tmux/notes-open.sh). The likely ones come first, from what the tab is
# about: notes that mention its ticket or PR number, then those whose title
# shares words with the tab's name, then the note last shown beside it, then
# those that mention its repository's name, then the rest, most recently
# changed first. The notes are searched here, on the Mac, and sent nowhere.
#
# Usage:
#   note-pick.sh ask <window> <client>   in a popup on <client>; M-e runs it
#                                        for a tab with no note yet, and M-p's
#                                        "Choose this tab's note" any time
#   note-pick.sh list <window>           the ranked list, a "<title>\t<path>"
#                                        line each (the tests read it)
#
# "Keep whatever is open" records that the tab was asked (@tab_note_asked), so
# M-e doesn't ask again; Esc leaves it to ask next time.
