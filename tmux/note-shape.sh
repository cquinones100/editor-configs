# Shapes a note's to-dos as Linear tickets, for the M-p action: pick a note,
# the checklist items to shape (every unticked one, to start with), and the
# repo they belong to, and each item gets its own tab running /shape, through
# shape-batch. /shape looks for a ticket that already covers an item first,
# and offers to resume shaping that one instead.
#
# Usage: note-shape.sh   (from a popup; the current tab's repo is offered first)
#
# The notes are the notes app's (bin/notes): Markdown in $NOTES_DIR or ~/Notes,
# the one open in the app first. An item is an unticked top-level "- [ ]"
# line, and everything indented under it is part of its ticket: lines that
# aren't checklist items are its details, and unticked checklist items at the
# first level under it are its sub-items, each a ticket of its own, with
# anything indented under them as their details. A ticked item, and all that
# is under it, is done and left out. /shape gets the item on one line, with
# the note's title, its details and its sub-items labelled, and asks first
# whether an item with sub-items should become a Linear project with them as
# its issues.
