#!/bin/zsh

# Asks which directory to open something in, from the ones you work in, and
# prints it. For the popups that open a tab running Claude: new-tab.zsh (M-t,
# M-n) and shape-open.zsh (the palette's "Continue shaping Linear tickets").
#
# Usage: dir=$(pick-dir.zsh "<what Enter does>") || exit 0
#
# An fzf list, the way the Slack relay's places and the Work map find them:
# the directory you are in first (the popup's -d), then every open tab's, then
# every one a Claude session ran in, most recent first, from wt-revive's cache
# (~/.cache/wt-revive/index.json, kept fresh by the sidebar daemon), then your
# home. Only directories that still exist are listed, and no worktree but the
# one you are in. Type to narrow it; Enter takes the chosen one, or, when
# nothing matches, what you typed if it is a directory. Exits 1 on Esc or a
# path that isn't a directory, having said which.
