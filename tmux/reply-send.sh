# Sends the last reply Claude gave in this tab to another tab, for the M-p
# action: pick the tab, and the reply is pasted into its Claude's prompt (or
# its active pane when it runs no Claude) without Enter, and that tab comes to
# the front, so you can add to it before sending.
#
# Usage: reply-send.sh   (from a popup: the tab is the one it was opened over)
#
# The reply is read by bin/claude-reply, a node script. The tmux server has no
# node on its PATH (see window-revive.sh), so nvm's default is added here.
#
# It goes in as a bracketed paste, so its line breaks stay in the text rather
# than each pressing Enter.
