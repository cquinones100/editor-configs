# Runs slack-relay from a tmux binding: `start` (the default, M-S) opens the
# relay's tab or goes to it if it is already running, `stop` (C-M-s) stops it.
#
# Usage: slack-relay-open.sh [start|stop]
#
# The tmux server keeps the environment it was started with, which has no
# node (nvm is set up in ~/.zshrc, which only interactive shells read), so a
# node script run straight from a binding dies on `env: node: No such file or
# directory`. The default Node is put on the PATH first, as window-jump.sh does.
# The relay's own tab runs an interactive zsh, so it has node either way.
