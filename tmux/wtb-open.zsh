# Popup for M-B, "Start work on a branch, new or existing, in a new tab
# (wtb)": an fzf list of the repository's branches, local and remote, most
# recently committed first, and runs `wtb` with the one picked in a new tab, the
# way wtpr-open.zsh runs `wtpr` for PRs. Typing a name no branch matches and
# pressing Enter creates it; ctrl-n creates the name typed even when branches
# match it.
#
# Usage: wtb-open.zsh
#
# The tab starts in the focused pane's directory (the binding's -d), so the
# worktree is made in that repository. The list is read from the refs already
# here, with no fetch, so a branch pushed since the last fetch is typed by name.
# `wtb` is typed into the new tab's interactive shell rather than run as its
# command, as wtpr-open.zsh does: the shell is what defines it, from ~/.zshrc,
# and it stays in the worktree after Claude exits. So only a name git accepts
# as a branch is ever typed.
